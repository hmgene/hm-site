## 🔬 Core Analysis Services

I provide reliable, publication-ready bioinformatics analyses for genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics datasets. Services are modular and customizable based on project goals.

### 🧬 RNA-seq & Transcriptomics
- Alignment & quantification (STAR, Salmon, Kallisto)
- Differential expression (DESeq2, edgeR, limma-voom)
- Isoform analysis, alternative splicing, fusion detection
- Pathway and enrichment analysis (GSEA, GO, KEGG)

### 🧠 Single-Cell Analysis
- Preprocessing (Cell Ranger, STARsolo, Alevin)
- Clustering & dimensionality reduction (Seurat, Scanpy)
- Cell type annotation & marker detection
- Pseudotime and trajectory analysis

### 🧪 Epigenomics (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, Methylation)
- Peak calling and signal quantification (MACS2, HOMER)
- Differential accessibility & motif analysis
- TF footprinting and chromatin state modeling
- Methylation calling and differential methylation (bsseq, DSS)

### 🧮 Copy Number & Structural Variation
- CNV and SV inference from WGS/WES/ATAC-seq
- CNV-aware signal modeling
- Integration with gene expression and regulatory data

## 🧩 Pipeline Development & Automation

I build reproducible pipelines for high-throughput labs using:

- **Nextflow / Snakemake / Galaxy**
- **Docker / Singularity / Conda**
- Custom pipelines tailored to lab-specific protocols
- CI/CD integration for large-scale projects

## 📦 Reporting & Deliverables

- 📄 Publication-ready figures and reports (PDF or HTML)
- 🧾 Methods section text for grants and manuscripts
- 🗃️ Access to project GitHub or cloud folders
- 💻 Interactive notebooks (R Markdown, Jupyter)

## 💬 Collaboration Models

| Model            | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Hourly**       | Best for small or exploratory requests     |
| **Milestone**    | Fixed-fee per dataset or analysis module   |
| **Monthly**      | Ongoing support embedded within your lab   |
| **Grant-based**  | I join as a paid bioinformatics co-investigator or consultant |

Would you like me to:
- Add example prices or turnaround time?
- Include a downloadable service brochure PDF?
- Customize this to a specific area (e.g., cancer, neuro, developmental)?

Let me know, and I’ll adjust this to your audience.
