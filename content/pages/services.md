I offer two service models:
- Project-based model: Charges 10‚Äì20% of my effort per project, covering services from data analysis to the final publication.
- Hourly model: Flat-rate service with up-to-date or custom solutions (starting around $100/hour, adjustable).

Pricing is explained transparently based on three factors:
- Gain: Value of the data or insights generated.
- Cost Savings: Efficiency improvements via software or workflow optimization.
- Risk Reduction: Quality control of the data, considering our current infrastructure conditions.

I have already applied this model to a 15% effort contract per PI/project this year, and I anticipate several similar contracts will be available in the near future.

I expect that revenue could increase to cover up to 100% of my effort next year, and I am confident in identifying what is most valuable and attractive for each PI‚Äôs project.

I would be happy to discuss the details further at your convenience. Thank you.
